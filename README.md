## About MiniSigma

MiniSigma is a Discord bot designed to turn Discord message reactions into "Like" and "Dislike" buttons that place users on a global scoreboard. The bot reflects user score (likes - dislikes + 100) through leaderboard commands, as well as updating the user's guild-specific nickname (a user named `CrazyJim` becomes `CrazyJim (143 IQ)`). Thus, the bot essentially adds an approval rating to each user that improves with time and quality of posts in text channels.

The idea for MiniSigma came when some friends and I would add or subtract "IQ" from each other's nicknames in our server whenever they made a joke we deemed good or bad. This, mixed with the fact we had added custom Reddit 'upvote' and 'downvote' server emojis, led me to automate the entire process.
